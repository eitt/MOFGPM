Figure: fig1_aggregated_ratio_view.png
Caption: Figure 1. Aggregated ratio view of GA_scaled_total_24h versus FlexSim mean (10 replications).
Alt text: Left panel shows scenario-level ratio values with blue points for non-mismatch and red points for capacity-horizon mismatch; point size reflects FlexSim served patients. Right panel shows decile-averaged ratio with 95% confidence intervals and mismatch-rate bars.

Figure: fig2_aggregated_kpi_summary.png
Caption: Figure 2. Aggregated KPI summary: overall levels and ratio distribution.
Alt text: Left panel compares overall mean aggregate KPI for FlexSim and GA scaled 24-hour values with confidence intervals. Right panel shows the distribution of ratio GA_scaled_total_24h divided by FlexSim mean for mismatch and non-mismatch groups, with parity at 1.
