8.1 External validation with FlexSim (served-within-24h reconciliation)

GA all-finished metrics are not directly comparable to FlexSim 24h outputs.
Validation is performed on the served within 24h cohort to align denominators and avoid the Dylan vs Laura discrepancy.
KPI definition: aggregate waiting/attention metric computed only on patients served within 24h.
FlexSim KPI uses FS_mean (average of 10 replications) and FS_ci95 = 1.96*FS_std/sqrt(10).
GA comparable KPI uses GA_scaled_total_24h = GA_avg_wait_per_served * FlexSim Patient.
Main figures are aggregated for readability; detailed scenario-by-scenario comparison is provided in Appendix Figure A1.

Matched staffing scenarios: 144.
Observed GA total patients per sample (all-finished cohort): 35.00.
Average GA served within 24h: 12.77 patients.
Average FlexSim served within 24h (Patient): 17.29 patients.
Capacity/horizon mismatch flags: 113 scenarios.
Scenarios with |z|<2 (GA_scaled_total_24h vs FlexSim mean): 0.7%.

Primary comparison uses GA_avg_wait_per_served vs FS_avg_wait_per_served.
Secondary comparison uses GA_scaled_total_24h vs FS_mean.
