Unified Results Section (Baseline -> Sensitivity -> FlexSim Validation)

Methodology order follows the baseline-anchored design:
1) baseline feasibility diagnosis, 2) staffing sensitivity analysis, 3) external FlexSim validation.

Baseline diagnosis:
- Target patients in 24h: 36
- Patients generated by GA in baseline sample: 35
- Patients served within 24h in baseline sample: 11
- Maximum completion time in baseline sample (min): 3393.01
- Interpretation: baseline schedule is NOT feasible for the 24h target (backlog remains after 24h).

Sensitivity analysis focuses on average attended patients/day across staffing combinations (Doctor, Nurse, Assistant, Specialist).
Validation then compares GA scaled 24h KPI against FlexSim KPI means from 10 replications.

Matched scenarios in validation: 144
Capacity/horizon mismatch flags: 113
Scenarios with |z|<2 (GA_scaled_total_24h vs FlexSim mean): 0.7%
